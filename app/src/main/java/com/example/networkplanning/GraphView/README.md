GraphView
===========

Android GraphView is used to display data in graph structures.

Overview
========
The library can be used within `RecyclerView` and currently works with small graphs only.

**This project is currently experimental and the API subject to breaking changes without notice.**

Download
========
The library is only available on MavenCentral. Please add this code to your build.gradle file on project level:
```gradle
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    mavenCentral()
  }
}
```

And add the dependency to the build.gradle file within the app module:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'dev.bandb.graphview:graphview:0.8.1'
}
```
Layouts
======
### Tree
Uses Walker's algorithm with Buchheim's runtime improvements (`BuchheimWalkerLayoutManager` class). Currently only the `TreeEdgeDecoration` can be used to draw the edges. Supports different orientations. All you have to do is using the `BuchheimWalkerConfiguration.Builder.setOrientation(int)` with either `ORIENTATION_LEFT_RIGHT`, `ORIENTATION_RIGHT_LEFT`, `ORIENTATION_TOP_BOTTOM` and
`ORIENTATION_BOTTOM_TOP` (default). Furthermore parameters like sibling-, level-, subtree separation can be set.
### Directed graph
Directed graph drawing by simulating attraction/repulsion forces. For this the algorithm by Fruchterman and Reingold (`FruchtermanReingoldLayoutManager` class) was implemented. To draw the edges you can use `ArrowEdgeDecoration` or `StraightEdgeDecoration`.
### Layered graph
Algorithm from Sugiyama et al. for drawing multilayer graphs, taking advantage of the hierarchical structure of the graph (`SugiyamaLayoutManager` class). Currently only the `SugiyamaArrowEdgeDecoration` can be used to draw the edges. You can also set the parameters for node and level separation using the `SugiyamaConfiguration.Builder`.

Usage
======
GraphView must be integrated with `RecyclerView`.
For this youâ€™ll need to add a `RecyclerView` to your layout and create an item layout like usually when working with `RecyclerView`.

```xml
<com.otaliastudios.zoom.ZoomLayout
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    app:hasClickableChildren="true">

    <androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
        android:id="@+id/recycler"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content" />

</com.otaliastudios.zoom.ZoomLayout>
```

Currently GraphView must be used together with a Zoom Engine like [ZoomLayout](https://github.com/natario1/ZoomLayout). To change the zoom values just use the different attributes described in the ZoomLayout project site.

To create a graph, we need to instantiate the `Graph` class. Next submit your graph to your Adapter, for that you must extend from the `AbstractGraphAdapter` class.

```kotlin
private void setupGraphView {
    val recycler = findViewById(R.id.recycler)

    // 1. Set a layout manager of the ones described above that the RecyclerView will use.
    val configuration = BuchheimWalkerConfiguration.Builder()
                    .setSiblingSeparation(100)
                    .setLevelSeparation(100)
                    .setSubtreeSeparation(100)
                    .setOrientation(BuchheimWalkerConfiguration.ORIENTATION_TOP_BOTTOM)
                    .build()
    recycler.layoutManager = BuchheimWalkerLayoutManager(context, configuration)

    // 2. Attach item decorations to draw edges
    recycler.addItemDecoration(TreeEdgeDecoration())

    // 3. Build your graph
    val graph = Graph()
    val node1 = Node("Parent")
    val node2 = Node("Child 1")
    val node3 = Node("Child 2")

    graph.addEdge(node1, node2)
    graph.addEdge(node1, node3)

    // 4. You will need a simple Adapter/ViewHolder.
    // 4.1 Your Adapter class should extend from `AbstractGraphAdapter`
    adapter = object : AbstractGraphAdapter<NodeViewHolder>() {

        // 4.2 ViewHolder should extend from `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`
        override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): NodeViewHolder {
            val view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.context)
                    .inflate(R.layout.node, parent, false)
            return NodeViewHolder(view)
        }

        override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: NodeViewHolder, position: Int) {
            holder.textView.text = getNodeData(position).toString()
        }
    }.apply {
        // 4.3 Submit the graph
        this.submitGraph(graph)
        recycler.adapter = this
    }
}
```

Customization
======
You can change the edge design by supplying your custom paint object to your edge decorator.
```kotlin
    val edgeStyle = Paint(Paint.ANTI_ALIAS_FLAG).apply {
        strokeWidth = 5f
        color = Color.BLACK
        style = Paint.Style.STROKE
        strokeJoin = Paint.Join.ROUND
        pathEffect = CornerPathEffect(10f) 
    }
    
    recyclerView.addItemDecoration(TreeEdgeDecoration(edgeStyle))
```

If you want that your nodes are all the same size you can set `useMaxSize` to `true`. The biggest node defines the size for all the other nodes.
```kotlin
    recyclerView.layoutManager = BuchheimWalkerLayoutManager(this, configuration).apply { 
        useMaxSize = true
    }
```
